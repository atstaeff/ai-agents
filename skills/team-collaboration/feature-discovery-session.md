# Feature Discovery Session Skill

## Instructions for AI
Collaboratively explore, refine, and prioritize new feature ideas with stakeholders and users.

## Session Design

### Pre-Session Setup (7-10 days ahead)

**Define Session Scope**
- What product area are you exploring?
- Who needs to participate?
- What decisions need to be made?
- How much time do you need?

**Participant Selection**
Invite a diverse group:
- People who understand user needs deeply
- Technical experts who know what's feasible
- Decision-makers who can prioritize
- Users who will actually use the features (when possible)

Ideal group size: 6-12 people

**Pre-Session Homework**
Send participants:
- Current product state and vision
- Known user pain points and requests
- Any existing feature proposals
- Session goals and expected outcomes

### Session Structure (3 hours total)

**Part 1: Frame the Context (25 minutes)**

Start by aligning everyone:
- Review product direction and goals
- Share recent user feedback and data
- Clarify constraints (technical, timeline, budget)
- Explain how today's session fits into planning

**Part 2: Idea Generation (50 minutes)**

*Individual Thinking (12 minutes)*
Give everyone quiet time to generate ideas:
- Write down user problems they've observed
- Sketch potential solutions
- Note opportunities they've been considering

*Group Sharing (38 minutes)*
Go around and have each person present their ideas:
- Others listen without judging
- Group similar concepts together
- Ask clarifying questions only
- Record everything on a shared board

**Part 3: Idea Refinement (55 minutes)**

Select the most promising ideas to explore deeply.

For each selected idea, work through:

*Problem Clarity*
- Who experiences this problem?
- How often does it occur?
- What's the impact when it happens?
- Why haven't they solved it another way?

*Solution Exploration*
- How might this work from a user's perspective?
- What alternatives could address the same need?
- What assumptions are we making?

*Impact Assessment*
- What improves if we build this?
- How will we know it's successful?
- What risks exist?

Capture using this format:
```
Idea: [Concise name for the feature]

User Need: [The problem this addresses]
Who Benefits: [Specific user types]
Frequency: [How often this need arises]

Proposed Approach: [How it might work]
Alternative Options: [Other ways to solve this]

Success Indicators: [How we'll measure impact]
- Metric 1: [What and target]
- Metric 2: [What and target]

Complexity Estimate: [Small / Medium / Large / Extra Large]
Dependencies: [What else is required]
Risks: [What could go wrong]
```

**Part 4: Prioritization (40 minutes)**

Rank ideas using multiple perspectives:

*Value Dimension*
- How many users benefit?
- How much does it improve their experience?
- Does it align with strategic goals?
- What's the business impact?

*Effort Dimension*
- Engineering complexity
- Design requirements
- Required research or experimentation
- External dependencies

*Urgency Dimension*
- User demand intensity
- Competitive pressure
- Contractual commitments
- Technical debt implications

*Quick Sorting Exercise*
Place each idea in a grid:

```
High Impact + Low Effort = Build Soon
High Impact + High Effort = Plan Carefully  
Low Impact + Low Effort = Maybe Later
Low Impact + High Effort = Likely Skip
```

*Group Voting*
Give each person 5 votes to allocate across ideas however they choose. This reveals group priorities.

**Part 5: Roadmap Sketch (20 minutes)**

Organize prioritized ideas into time buckets:

Immediate Focus (Next 6-8 weeks)
- [Top priority items that are well understood]

Near Term (2-4 months out)
- [Important items needing more definition]

Future Consideration (Beyond 4 months)
- [Good ideas for later exploration]

Parking Lot
- [Ideas with merit but not prioritized now]

**Part 6: Next Actions (10 minutes)**

Before ending, establish:
- Who will write detailed specifications for top ideas
- When you'll review these specifications
- How you'll validate assumptions with users
- When you'll meet again to finalize plans
- How you'll communicate outcomes to broader team

## Facilitation Guidelines

**Energy Management**
- Take breaks every 60-75 minutes
- Use activities to change pace
- Watch for diminishing engagement

**Inclusive Participation**
- Ensure quieter voices are heard
- Balance time between participants
- Use written exercises to include introverts

**Productive Conflict**
- Encourage different viewpoints
- Keep discussion focused on ideas, not people
- Push for specific examples when opinions differ

**Decision Making**
- Be clear about who has final authority
- Don't aim for consensus on everything
- Document disagreements when they matter

## Tools and Techniques

**For Remote Sessions**
- Use digital whiteboard tools (Miro, FigJam, Mural)
- Leverage breakout rooms for small group work
- Use polls for quick feedback
- Record the session for those who couldn't attend

**For In-Person Sessions**
- Large sticky notes for ideas
- Markers and whiteboards
- Dot stickers for voting
- Wall space to display all ideas

## Post-Session Work

**Within 48 Hours**
- Consolidate and organize all captured ideas
- Share session outcomes with participants
- Distribute prioritized list to stakeholders
- Schedule follow-up sessions as needed

**Within 2 Weeks**
- Create detailed specifications for top priorities
- Validate assumptions through user research
- Get technical feasibility assessments
- Update product roadmap

## Success Signals
- Participants leave with clear understanding of priorities
- Multiple concrete, well-defined ideas emerge
- Group alignment on what matters most
- Action items have owners and timelines
- Energy and enthusiasm about possibilities

## Watch Out For
- Jumping to solutions before understanding problems
- Letting one person dominate the discussion
- Not managing time effectively
- Failing to capture ideas systematically
- Skipping validation of assumptions
- Not following through after the session

# Progress Sync Skill

## Instructions for AI
Run meetings that keep everyone informed without wasting time.

## Before the Meeting

**Gather Intelligence** (2 days before)
- Ask team members for updates via your preferred channel
- Review work tracking tools for current state
- Note any concerning patterns or blockers
- Prepare specific questions for unclear items

**Set the Agenda** (1 day before)
- List topics that need group discussion
- Share the agenda with estimated time for each item
- Include materials people should review beforehand
- Make it clear what outcomes you need

## Meeting Flow

### Opening (3 minutes)
- State what you want to accomplish today
- Confirm everyone can hear/see properly
- Review how long you have

### Progress Snapshot (15 minutes)
Share what's moving forward:
- Completed items since last sync
- Active work and its status
- What's queued up next

Use indicators to show health at a glance:
- Green dot: No issues, progressing as expected
- Yellow dot: Minor concerns, watching closely
- Red dot: Blocked or significantly delayed

### Obstacle Discussion (20 minutes)
Address what's stuck:
- Describe each blocker clearly
- Determine who can help resolve it
- Assign someone to own the solution
- Set a deadline for follow-up

For each obstacle, capture:
- What's blocked
- Why it's blocked
- Who's working on it
- When you'll check back

### Looking Ahead (10 minutes)
Preview what's coming:
- Work starting soon
- Upcoming deadlines
- Resource needs
- Dependencies between teams

### Action Capture (5 minutes)
Summarize what people committed to:
- Specific actions with owners
- Deadlines for each
- How you'll track progress

### Open Questions (7 minutes)
- Field clarifying questions
- Note items needing offline discussion
- Confirm next meeting time

## Meeting Principles

**Respect Time**
Start when scheduled. End when scheduled. If you finish early, give time back.

**Stay Focused**
If a discussion needs deep technical detail, schedule a separate session with relevant people.

**Capture Everything**
Document decisions, action items, and blockers as they happen, not after.

**Follow Through**
Within 24 hours, distribute notes showing what was decided and who's doing what.

## Information Display

Create a simple status overview:

```
Current Sprint Status
Completed: [List major items finished]
In Progress: [Show what's actively being worked on with owners]
Blocked: [Highlight obstacles preventing progress]
Starting Next: [Preview upcoming work]

Key Numbers
- Items finished this period: X
- Items in progress: Y  
- Open blockers: Z
- Team capacity usage: N%

Important Dates
- Next milestone: [Date and what's included]
- Release window: [When you're shipping]
- Review deadlines: [When decisions are needed]
```

## For Meeting Leaders

**Your Role**
- Keep discussions productive
- Note when topics need separate meetings
- Ensure action items have clear owners
- Summarize decisions before moving on
- Watch for people trying to speak
- End on time

**Red Flags to Watch For**
- Same blockers appearing multiple meetings
- Vague status updates that avoid specifics
- Action items without owners
- Team members consistently silent
- Running over time every meeting

## For Participants

**Come Prepared**
- Know what you've completed, what's in progress, what's blocked
- Have data to back up status claims
- Think through questions beforehand

**Communicate Clearly**
- Give concrete examples
- Flag problems early
- Propose solutions when raising issues
- Be honest about timeline concerns

**Engage Actively**
- Ask questions when confused
- Offer help when you can
- Take notes on items affecting you
- Follow up on your commitments

## Remote Meeting Adaptations
